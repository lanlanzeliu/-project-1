First time I spent 8 hours to do this homework and I didn't get good grade about it. So I tried to fix it around 5 hours. So this time I understand the request of this project well with the help from you. Then I draw the outline and them fill the detail information in the outline. Third I compare what I did before and see where I did wrong and fix. Last step is fixing error.
From this project, it is a good start for me to learn how to write a program.
